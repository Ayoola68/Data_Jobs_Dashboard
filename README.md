# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI

## Introduction

This dashboard was developed to support **job seekers**, **career transitioners**, and **professionals** exploring opportunities in the data-science domain. Labour-market information is often dispersed across multiple platforms, making it difficult to understand prevailing trends. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data-science* job postings—covering job titles, salary estimates, and geographic locations—the report provides a streamlined, interactive interface that allows users to examine employment patterns, role distributions, and compensation structures efficiently and objectively.

## Objectives

The objective of this analysis is to systematically evaluate the characteristics of data science job postings, including job titles, salary bands, hiring locations, and associated demand patterns. The project aims to:

- Identify high-demand job roles across the data-science profession.

- Examine salary variations by role and geography.

- Assess spatial clustering of job opportunities.

- Provide an evidence-based foundation for career guidance, workforce planning, and organisational recruitment strategies.

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables**  to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**  
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI

## Introduction

This dashboard was developed to support **job seekers**, **career transitioners**, and **professionals** exploring opportunities in the data-science domain. Labour-market information is often dispersed across multiple platforms, making it difficult to understand prevailing trends. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data-science* job postings—covering job titles, salary estimates, and geographic locations—the report provides a streamlined, interactive interface that allows users to examine employment patterns, role distributions, and compensation structures efficiently and objectively.

## Objectives

The objective of this analysis is to systematically evaluate the characteristics of data science job postings, including job titles, salary bands, hiring locations, and associated demand patterns. The project aims to:

- Identify high-demand job roles across the data-science profession.

- Examine salary variations by role and location.

- Assess spatial clustering of job opportunities.

- Provide an evidence-based foundation for career guidance, workforce planning, and organisational recruitment strategies.
